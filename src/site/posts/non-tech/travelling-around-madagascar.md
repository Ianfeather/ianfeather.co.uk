Last year, my wife and I took our honeymoon in Madagascar. It was an incredible trip that I would recommend to anyone. The views, the wildlife and most of all the people, made it an unforgettable experience.

Before we went, there was a lot of uncertainty about how it would be though. We heard the roads were terrible, the flights were unpredictable and that we had to be accompanied by a driver? How would that work?

In the end it worked out brilliantly but I'd have loved a little more information beforehand. I hope this post helps you if you're planning a similar trip.

## Our Route

We went for 2.5 weeks and our rough itinerary was:

- Antananarivo
- Morondava
- Tsingy
- Antananarivo
- Ambositra
- Ambalavao
- Anja Park
- Isalo
- Tulear
- Antananarivo

We knew this was going to be tough to fit in especially as we'd heard in advance that getting around was slow going. What wasn't clear to us was how we could get around. Were buses an option? Were flights as highly unreliable as we had read? If we booked a driver should we get one for the entire trip - and how do we find a good driver anyway?

To try to get a sense of this I spoke to a few old friends at Lonely Planet to get and also scoured Trip Advisor for information. Ultimately, there's no tip quite like one from Madagascar so getting in touch with someone there is always going to be useful - particularly as routes might change due to weather or safety concerns. The following are useful avenues for information:

- *Your hotel in Antananarivo*. Hotels typically got back to us within 24 hrs and with Tana being almost everyone's first stop they have a lot of information and advice they can share.
- *Gary (West Coast)*. Gary runs a hotel in Morondava. He specialises in off-track river tours on the West Coast but also organises tours to Tsingy, the Avenue des Baobabs and can book you a trip almost anywere in Madagascar. We originally found him via his comments on Trip Advisor about the safety of the road to Tsingy.
- *Mada Jack*. Our driver for 10 days. Speaks good english, knows everyone and was a joy to travel with. I can't recommend him enough. You can reach him via email, facebook or call him on ..

### Our full itinerary
- Day 1: Land Antananarivo (Stay at hotel...)
- Day 3: Fly to Morondava with Air..., Stay at ..., Meet Gary and the driver he's organised, see the avenue des baobabs. The hotel organised a taxi to collect us from the airport.
- Day 4: Drive to Tsingy (long!) stay at ..... The hotel tries to be a bit fancier than it is maybe, i think it's one of the better ones, but you almost can't not stay there because the view is just out of this world
- Days 5-7: Tsingy and then drive back
- Day 8: Fly back to Tana. Meet Jack. Drive to Ambositra. Stayed at...
- Day 9: Drive to Ambalavao. Stay at...
- Day 10: Drive to Isalo via Anja Park (the best place we saw lemurs by far - you can get very close to wild Lemurs)
- Day 11-12: Stay in Isalo. We stayed at ... which was our favourite hotel and spot along the way. You felt like you were staying somewhere truly special.
- Day 13: Drive to Tulear. Stay at... This place has truly amazing architecture and just 3 rooms which are so different. Expensive but worth it.
- Day 14 - 17: Stay at... Not worth the money in our opinion. You pay european prices and it feels extremely resort/touristy. That said, it was a nice place to just relax. They organize the boat for you but if you decide to stay somewhere else down the beach the hotel should be able to help you book it for you.
Day 18: Back to Antananarivo. Stay at... Fine hotel with a nice restaurant. I preferred the other one personally but this one was very popular.
Day 19: Flight home.


## FAQ about getting a driver. Or questions I frequently asked.

### Should you get one for the whole trip?
We didn't, we got one for the main portion of the trip and flew to the west coast and back. Given our short time I was really glad we did this - you deal with enough driving as it is.

If you have plenty of time though, there's something to be said for the consistency because we really got to know our second driver and would have enjoyed continuing with him.

### Are drivers around you all the time?
They're not. A lot of the time you're going to be following similar tourist routes and the drivers all hang out together. We'd always buy him a beer when we arrived at a place and after that we'd be on our own. They're available if you need them though.

### Do they sort hotels for you?
They definitely can, and they probably know some good deals, but we opted to handle that ourselves and that seemed to be the default. Chat to your driver ahead of time if you want them to do it for you.

### How to find good hotels along the way
The usuals: Lonely Planet, booking.com etc. We found that booking.com occasionally said the hotel was full but if we emailed them they still had rooms so sometimes it's better to speak directly. Internet isn't great in Madagascar but it's fine for sending emails back and forth and people were fairly quick to respond.

### Where does the driver stay
At every hotel there are driver rooms where they stay. It's either paid for by the driver, the agent or the hotel provides it. We never asked. But there's no expectation for you to explicitly cover this cost.

### How to find a driver
We didn't find any great ways to figure this out. There were some email address at the back of the Lonely Planet that we sent a message to, we also went to https://www.madagascarbycar.com/ and emailed them. We ended up with a few similar quotes and no real way of knowing which we should go with.

In the end we booked with Stan of MadagascarByCar. When we got to the airport to meet him it turned out he wouldn't be driving us as he was booked on another trip. This was a little disconcerting because we chose him based off the reviews we read. He subcontracted us to a driver called Jack instead. This seems very common because all the drivers know each other really well. In the end it worked out great for us but it would have been nice to know up front.

If I was going again, there's no doubt I would speak directly to Jack and organise through him. He speaks perfect French and Malagasy and very good English.

I'd definitely recommend you get in touch with him either via his Facebook Page, email at jackfiniaina@gmail.com or give him a call on +26134 48 687 48 / +26133 09 723 23. He's extremely friendly and capable.

Our driver on the west coast was organised via [Remote River Tours](https://www.remoterivers.com/en/docs/home.php) and they were also good.

### Do you need a 4x4?
We'd read that we needed a 4x4 and had asked this up front but to be honest, your driver will figure this out for you. If you're doing a full loop of Madagascar he'll make sure you're in a 4x4 with a snorkel because that's what you need. If you do a trip like we did you'll be in a slightly cruiser 4x4. Trust them on this, they don't want to get stuck any more than you!


### Can you just rent a car yourself?
I think in theory it's possible but the driving is pretty specialised. The cities are chaotic, the overtaking on the highways uses a language of horns and certain sections definitely require 4x4 skills (such as driving through rivers, driving on to makeshift ferries etc.). So, maybe it's possible, but having been through it we were definitely happy that we weren't doing the driving.


## Flights
We'd heard they were unreliable but either we got lucky or they've gotten better. We had no problems. In fact one time the plane left an hour early because everyone had arrived! The views are spectacular.

The only real constraint here was that the planes don't travel each route daily. We ended up having to organise our trip around this constraint a little bit so it's something to bear in mind.

We took three plane journeys:
- tulear to tana - €130 pp
- tana to morondava - €130 pp
- morondava to tana - €119 pp

## Money
Euros are the best currency to take with you. You can change them for local currency at the airport in Tana. You give them three notes and they give you back three hundred! You walk out looking so conspicuous but we never had any problems with safety there.

All the hotels we stayed at were happy to be paid in Euros which really helped us know how much to convert - still worth checking with them though. They'll give you change in Malagasy which was good for us. Your hotel will probably be able to change money for you or find you someone in town who can.

## Safety
We felt that Tana was fairly safe but were told it was actually dangerous by many people that we met and trusted. After dark you should get your hotel to sort you out with a taxi rather than walking - which the porters will happily do for a small tip.

We'd heard that the road from Morondava to Tsingy had been dangerous and that it wasn't possible to travel that way any more. This wasn't the case once we got there. The army had worked to get on top of the problem to ensure it was safe for tourism. We had to travel part of the way (maybe 3-4 hours) in convoy with the other tourist Jeeps, and we got a soldier as a passenger to keep us company. It always felt safe. I assume this is a changeable situation so for the latest on this I'd recommend reaching out to Gary at [Remote River Tours](https://www.remoterivers.com/en/docs/home.php).


## Other tips

### Take sweets, pens, paper and other treats for the children!
I really wish someone had told us this beforehand! We did the entire west coast portion of the trip not knowing and you meet families in incredibly remote parts of the country with very few belongings. When the car stops you're invariably serenaded with shouts of 'bonbon' and 'pen'! We had one pen and gave it to a child who was so thrilled to receive it. You can make a big difference with small gifts.

### Take photos of the kids, and use Snapchat
Without any treats we resorted to taking pictures of the kids and showing them their faces. They got a huge kick of it. Using Snapchat to show themselves with Hat, Sunglasses and beards was such a crowdpleaser and so fun for us.

## You need 3 nights / 2 full days in Tsingy
The journey is brutal - about 12 hours each way on terrible "roads". Some people spent a day after the trip just recovering and to do that trip twice just for a single day would be really tough.

## Internet
There's no mobile data but WiFi is available in most hotels and some bars which is fine for email and social media - though you're not going to be streaming. You can contact hotels via email and they get back to you pretty fast.
