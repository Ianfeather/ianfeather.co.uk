I chose to speak [@frontendlondon](http://twitter.com/frontendlondon) on this subject but, given the small audience, I wanted to create a guide that would work online in isolation from the talk. As such I created this [interactive overview](http://www.ianfeather.co.uk/presentations/front-end-ops) exposing some of the core concepts that we associate with Front End Ops.

This guide doesn't cover topics such as Grunt, Bower or Yeoman, instead it approaches the subject at a broader level. Hitting 'i' at any point will reveal some more background and some useful links about each topic that was covered, allowing you to dig deeper into each if interested.

The [presentation](http://www.ianfeather.co.uk/presentations/front-end-ops) was built using [impress.js](bartaz.github.io/impress.js/â€Ž) and I used [remote-impress](https://github.com/edjafarov/remote-impress/) for the presentation. Mobile devices are served a more linear version of the guide so it is reccomended to view it on a desktop if you have access to one.
