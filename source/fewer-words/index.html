<div class="blog-archives blog-index fewer-words">

  <p class="section-intro">I started this section so I coud write a few spontaneous posts without the pressure of following any essay-esque articles. By their name you can assume they'll be short and it's likely they will be free of any ongoing narrative, including the web industry.</p>

  {% for post in site.posts reverse %}
    {% if post.categories contains 'fewer-words' %}
      <article class="blog-archive-entry">
        {% include fewer_words_post.html %}
