Last year, my wife and I took our honeymoon in Madagascar. It was an incredible trip that I would recommend to anyone: the views, the wildlife and most of all the people, made it an unforgettable experience.

We went for 2.5 weeks and our rough itinerary was:
- Antananarivo
- Morondava
- Tsingy
- Antananarivo
- Ambositra
- Ambalavao
- Anja Park
- Isalo
- Tulear
- Antananarivo

We knew this was going to be tough to fit in especially as we'd heard in advance that getting around was slow going. What wasn't clear to us was how we could get around. Were buses an option? Were flights as highly unreliable as we had read? If we booked a driver should we get one for the entire trip - and how do we find a good driver anyway?

I spoke to a few old friends at Lonely Planet to get some tips, as well as scoured Trip Advisor which had some useful information despite being often out of date. Ultimately we managed to come up with a plan though we still set off to Madagascar feeling like we were heading into the unknown.

Hopefully this post can dispel a few myths as well as give you some useful contacts to get you started on your trip.

## Everything you need to know about getting a driver

- do you get one for the whole trip
- are they around you all the time
- do they sort hotels for you
- how to find hotels
- how to find a driver
- do you need a 4x4
- can you just rent a car? maybe, but we wouldn't have liked to drive
