One of the most common resistances to getting into running is the idea that it’s boring. I was exactly the same. These days I crave a run and adore the tingling fatigue in my legs that follows me the rest of the day. I’ve even had moments of genuine euphoria whilst running: something I never expected and it’s part of a remarkable transition in life and perspective. I don’t think this is just a case of getting older. I think anyone can find a love for running.

There are lots of ways of distracting yourself whilst running: listening to podcasts, exploring new surroundings or chatting with friends. I’m a huge fan of each. I want to concentrate of just the act of running solo, where the focus is only on you and the terrain around you, how does this become fascinating?

Is there a single more painful experience than running faster than you are capable? The pressure that builds in your chest and the fire that spreads throughout your lungs, the tightening in your throat which causes you to wheeze with each breath. The dizziness! And worst of all that sickening iron taste in the back of your mouth. As if every blood vessel is bursting as you scrape the rust from your fitness.

I have a hunch that this is the biggest killer of people getting back into running. We’ve all done it. You don’t run for months, years, and then you head out thinking you are still as fast as you used to be, push yourself beyond what you are capable of, remember this feeling, and wonder why you’re bothering.

Take it easy on those first few runs, don’t force it.

<h2 id="understand-your-heart-rate" class="blog-subtitle">Understand your heart rate</h2>

If you want to ensure that you don’t push yourself past your threshold you can invest in a heart rate monitor and regulate your pace that way. I get that this goes against the idea of simplicity in running and can sound a bit overkill but it really is worth it. You can also pick them up very cheap. I paid £20 for [this one](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003HT88JQ?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00): it fits under your shirt and syncs with a watch.

The idea of training with a heart rate monitor is to directly relate how you feel (your lungs, your legs etc.) with how fast your heart is working. If you can do that then you can regulate how the rest of your body feels simply by changing your pace to alter your heart rate.

Put simply, if you went out now and ran keeping your heart rate below 140bpm you’d pretty much be able to run indefinitely. There’d be no lactic acid running through your legs and no iron taste in your mouth. It’s all good, old, long lasting, aerobic activity.

The first few times you try it you’ll find it really hard to go slow enough to keep your heart rate low and you’ll get home feeling like you haven’t worked out at all. A few of these though and you’ll be surprised how much faster you can run whilst maintaining a low bpm.

It’s pretty nice to know roughly where you’re going to be heading, especially if it’s a long one, but there’s nothing like checking your GPS every few minutes to kill the enjoyment of a run. Of course, it’s a lot easier to do this when you know the area. Equally though, once you can run a reasonable distance and not get too tired it’s easy to not care if you get lost because how far wrong can you really go? If worst comes to worst you can always take the bus home.

One of my favourite runs is to head to Hampstead Heath and just explore the seemingly endless maze of tight trails and paths. It’s also great to get off the paths and just tear across a field: there are no people there, it’s uneven, steeper and just more fun! Running without caring how or where brings back that childlike enjoyment to it all and puts a grin on your face that you can’t run off.

I’m a glutton for endorphins and I think I quickly realised that you have some crazy power over yourself when you’re running. Once you’re able to run a long distance without being too tired, you have this incredible luxury in your hands.

I found that if I run with my heart rate at 165 for one minute, sometimes two, a huge rush of positive emotion floods through me. Tingling in my legs, thumping in my chest… throw in some music and sunshine and, honestly, it’s like being two pills deep into a Rob Da Bank Bestival Closer: utter, complete euphoria. It sounds ridiculous but even writing this out thinking about it puts a huge grin on my face.

That you have the unadulterated ability, alone, to create such intense feelings of joy simply by _moving_ is the greatest gift that running has given me. That realisation of the power of the human body. Yeah, you can take that back to the chemical inner workings of your body and mind but really that’s plain and centre a spiritual accomplishment. I know I’m not the only one that runs with a grin from ear to ear, laughing to the sky, confusing passers by.

<h2 id="cross-a-finish-line" class="blog-subtitle">Cross a finish line</h2>

Achieving personal gains without a goal is a tough one to crack.  Something has to motivate you to lace up your trainers and ‘getting fit’ is often only enough to get you started. Thankfully, achieving your goals also happens to be really fun, particularly if they push you harder than you are certain you're capable.

It's not about how far or how technical it is: a lap of the park, a 5k, a marathon, it doesn’t matter. Sprinting to the finish line even though you don’t need to is one of the nicest feelings there is and it always surprises you how much extra you are able to squeeze out of yourself. Stopping isn’t too bad either, nor is the post race beer with friends: sinking into the sofa with a smile and a satisfaction that only comes from smashing something you’ve been working so hard to attain.
