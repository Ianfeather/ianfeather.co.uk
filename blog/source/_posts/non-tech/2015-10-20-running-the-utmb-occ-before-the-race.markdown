The Ultra Trail de Mont Blanc offers five different races over a memorable week in August. This year I decided to do the OCC: the shortest of the five (a measly 54k and 10,000ft of ascent) and the only one that you can do without any qualifying points. I can't recommend it enough, it was an incredible experience start to finish.

I had a lot of questions leading up to it which I couldn't find answers for hence this attempt to provide them for future runners, and perhaps remind myself for next time.

<h2 id="admin" class="blog-subtitle">Admin</h2>

The registration period for all of the UTMB races is open for [three weeks, December to January](http://www.ultratrailmb.com/en/page/264/Enrolment.html) and this year you will need to have at least one qualifying point to even enter the OCC. These points are calculated from other ultras you have run throughout the past two years.

The registration is a lottery and last year there were 4,000 applicants for the 1200 places in the OCC. This is one of the reasons they now require a qualifying point for this race. If you get in you need to pay the full amount, otherwise your deposit is returned. I'd have to say the UTMB is one of the best value for money races I've ever been a part of. The organisation is second to none.

If you do get a place then it's time to focus on training but there are also a couple of really important admin pieces remaining. Firstly, you need to send off a Medical Certificate by a certain date. You need to get a doctor's signature on the certificate they provide you which proves you are medically capable of entering the race. This can be sourced from your local GP for a small fee or more simply if you happen to know a doctor who can lend you their signature.

The remaining thing you need to do is to book your place on the bus to the start line. The OCC starts from Orsieres in Switzerland and finishes in Chamonix. Buses start from 4am and the more preferable later ones fill up quickly. The later you book your bus: the earlier you will have to leave for the start line. This means, as I experienced, lots of waiting around in the cold before the race which is best avoided.

<h2 id="kit" class="blog-subtitle">Kit</h2>

Running is one of those beautiful, levelling activities which anyone can do: all you need is a pair of shoes, a pair of lungs and you're on your way. This is less the case with Ultra Marathons though, where you start to descend down the rabbit hole of purchasing technical gear. It can go pretty deep.

There is a required kit list for each of the races designed to keep the runner safe though even within this there is a wide gamut of options. For example, in the OCC you are required to carry a torch though the race is primarily run during the day. The only time you might need to use it is if you were running at the extreme of the allotted time. Of course, you should still absolutely carry a working torch for emergencies but it doesn't need to be the best in class. Alternatively, if you're running the full UTMB where you'll be running through two straight nights you'd very much want the best torch you could get!

For other items, spending more often leads to saving weight which is hugely important. I didn't go so far as to weigh items but I certainly kept a focus on how much I would have to be carrying. Keep your pack small and you limit yourself to only what is absolutely required. Here is the list of kit I used during the race, it seems like a lot but packed small and felt light throughout:

*[Salamon S-Lab Sense 4 trail shoes](http://www.wiggle.co.uk/salomon-s-lab-sense-4-ultra-shoes-aw15/)*. Incredible grip and comfort, saved me a few times on the sketchy down hill trails. Would absolutely recommend them: a popular choice amongst the runners at the UTMB.

*Shorts, t-shirt*. Nothing special. Nike.

*Socks*. A cheap purchase of Karrimor Marathon Socks from Sports Direct :) Great comfort and padding.

*[Ultimate Direction Vest](http://www.ultimatedirection.com/p-629-sj-ultra-vest-20.aspx)*. The range of running vests is big in both choice and price. This was a great purchase though, I took the 7l one and it was big enough to carry everything I needed with pockets in lots of different spots for snacks, your phone etc. Very comfortable, sits high on your back and I was personally a big fan of having the water bottles on my front. This vest also comes with an attached *whistle* which is a required item.

*Running Poles*. These are optional but almost all of the non-elites use them. I used a pair of lightweight foldable poles that I borrowed from my mum, no idea on the brand, and she only showed me they could extend taller once I'd finished the race! Still they were the perfect height for ascending and I preferred not to use them on the downhills so I could use my arms for balance. The ups and downs are very long in the Alps so it wasn't a bad thing to stop at the peak and take a moment to put them away.

*Waterproofs*. I carried a hiking waterproof jacket which, whilst really good and warm, was too bulky for my pack and took up the majority of the space. There are some excellent running waterproofs which fold down really small and were I to do it again I would probably invest more here. The waterproof jacket is a required item on all the races though as it turned out we ran in thirty degree sunshine all day. The waterproof trousers are optional for the OCC but required for all other races. I chose not to carry any but I would have had the forecast been worse.

*Torch*. I carried a head torch that I bought from Poundland. I probably wouldn't recommend doing that. Thankfully I never had to use it though it worked fine. You are required to carry a torch as well as spare batteries.

*Trousers*. A requirement. I took some cheap Karrimor leggings and never used them except for the journey there.

*Cap*. Indispensable. I took a lightweight [Zone 3 Cap](http://www.wiggle.co.uk/zone3-lightweight-cap/).

*Sunglasses*. I rarely ran with these because you're often running trails with a lot of cover. That said, they're a definite requirement. I went cheap again on these, taking this [dhb](http://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-triple-lens-sunglasses/) pair though I wouldn't recommend them unless you're on a budget.

*Mobile Phone, ID, cash* - All a requirement.

*Survival Blanket*. I took one I got free at a previous marathon.

*Beaker*. They stipulate you have to carry one that you can use for drinks at each aid station. I think it's a great idea, anything we can do to reduce the amount of plastic that gets used and wasted at races is a very good thing. I carried [this one](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00PUD396O) which I picked up in Chamonix though I never used it and drank solely from my water bottles.

*Adhesive bandage and blister pack*. The former is required and the latter is good sense. Thankfully I never had to use either.

*Extra phone battery*. Definitely not a requirement but I took this lightweight [Anker Battery Case](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00PRXHCPQ) as I wanted to ensure I could track my time/distance on Strava as well as stop and take photos when I wanted. Worked perfectly.

*Nutrition*. I took some [Shot Bloks](http://www.clifbar.com/products/clif-shot/shot-bloks), a Chia bar and a [beetroot shot](http://www.hollandandbarrett.com/shop/product/james-white-drinks-beet-it-beetroot-stamina-shot-60091372). There are enough aid stations to get by without needing to carry too much food. At the stations you generally have a choice of Orange slices, bananas, cheese, sausage, water, tea, coke and soup. The soup was a life saver for me at the last aid station as my stomach was really struggling.

*Water*. I didn't take a bladder, instead opting for just the litre of water in two bottles on the front of the vest. There is water at each aid station as well as at the summits and can occasionally also be found en route. In 30 degree heat that was enough as long as you ensured you had finished both bottles by the time you got to the checkpoint. I added [electrolyte tablets](http://www.wiggle.co.uk/high5-zero-electrolyte-drink-20-tabs/) to most of my water.


<h2 id="training" class="blog-subtitle">Training</h2>

At the start of 2015 I hadn't run longer than a 10k and the memory of my youth as a cross country runner had faded under the duress of a busy and fun lifestyle. My training was pretty steep and not very structured (you can do better!) but I still learnt a few things along the way.

<h3>Set yourself some milestones.</h3>

For me, the UTMB seemed so distant and out of reach that I needed some stepping stones to get there. I booked myself into a couple of 10ks to start with, then [Hackney half marathon](http://runhackney.com/half-marathon/) in May and a hilly marathon in June ([South Downs](http://www.marathonrunnersdiary.com/races/uk-marathons/salomon-south-downs-marathon.php)). I also did the London Triathlon in August though this was more of a distraction and probably shouldn't be advised (heaps of fun but also lots of time in the pool and on the bike that could have been used training).

<h3>Hit the hills.</h3>

Hills aren't the easiest thing to come by in London but any you can get your hands on will pay off in a big way. I ran Greenwich park, Hampstead Heath, Crystal Palace and Swains Lane. They're all relative tiddlers compared to the Alps but repetition is a good gift and if you can't afford, or are too busy, to get out of the city a lot then make do with what you have!

<h3>Hike.</h3>

This is something I didn't do beforehand but in retrospect I would. I hadn't realised how much hiking was involved at the UTMB and it's an acquired skill for sure. Watching some of the elites hiking at pace is quite impressive. It's also useful to practice technique with your poles before the race, finding a rhythm which feels comfortable for you.

<h3>Run downhill.</h3>

Definitely the most important lesson I learnt. When I ran the South Downs Marathon I hadn't really done any hill work and I massively paid the price.

When you run steep downhills your quads go through something called Eccentric Loading: essentially contracting to absorb the impact whilst simultaneously stretching as you complete your stride. This tears them to pieces and the pain can be crippling. Luckily it doesn't take much to harden them up. One hard downhill run and your quads build up a resilience which apparently can last 6 weeks. I did mine 10 days before the race and had no pain at all during it.

<h3>Run onsite.</h3>

As well as being a joy to spend a weekend in Chamonix it's also pretty much the best training ground you can ever hope for.

I went 10 days before the race and would recommend ideally going a couple of times during the summer. I wanted to tire my quads out and to get some practice running down the narrow, windy downhill sections. I definitely got that! I also got some terrible weather, running the second day almost entirely in a cloud. It was great fun though.

<figure class="full-screen-image image-with-fg-text">

    <figcaption class="fig-caption">The cable car disappearing into nothingness atop Flégère.</figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

On the first day I ran the vertical kilometre from Chamonix up to Brevent. This was a real eye opener and a true test for the quads. On the second day, on tired legs, I ran the last 18km of the race from Vallorcine, up to Flegere, and back down to Chamonix. I think having run part of the course gave me a big advantage during the latter stages of the actual race because I knew what was left and which were the final hurdles. On day 3, I had planned to do a final small run but my thighs were screaming so instead I strolled around Chamonix enjoying the view and then took my flight back.


<h2 id="diet" class="blog-subtitle">Diet</h2>

No masterclass here I'm afraid. Lots of veg, not much beer.

I cut down a lot on the amount of meat I ate and hugely increased my intake of vegetables, particularly green ones. The elite runners I spoke to all said the first thing they cut out was Dairy but I struggled to do that with my love of cheese. I cut out all snack food and instead tried to eat nuts or smoothies throughout the day when I was getting super hungry. I read [Finding Ultra](http://www.richroll.com/finding-ultra/) by Rich Roll which goes into a lot of detail about plant-based diets and the benefits fo them, I stole a few things from that book for sure. In fact, one of my favourites was a glass of water with some vinegar in each morning. It really perks you up and makes you feel better by rebalancing your Ph.

I cut down big on alcohol, turning down pints in the pub in favour of Ginger Beer (there's a gaping hole in the market for more interesting soft-drinks!) and removing my semi-regular evening beer or wine at home. This was hard to do, particularly when going out with friends but was one of the sacrifices I think you have to make.

I didn't let the diet monopolise my lifestyle though. There are clear benefits to being very strict about what you put inside your body: having a pure plant-based diet and being T-total but for me that wasn't a sacrifice I was entirely willing to make. I went on a good friend's stag do a few weeks before the race which probably set me back a long way but I had a great time and to me that was more important. I also enjoyed a nice steak from time to time: my motto was 'Everything in moderation'.


<h2 id="diet" class="blog-subtitle">When you get to Chamonix</h2>

There isn't all that much you have to do before the start line but they certainly have a knack for increasing the stress level. At least that's how I felt. My advice would be to get registration out of the way as soon as possible so you can just enjoy the atmosphere. The buzz around Chamonix is absolutely superb, unlike anything I've experienced before. We had fantastic weather and there were eager smiles from wall to wall.

In the centre of Chamonix, next to the Saturday market, there is a special Ultra Trail market where you can spend a small fortune on the last minute gear that might give you the advantage out on the trail. There is some great kit on offer and I was nearly tempted to trade up on my waterproof jacket though it turned out fine. You can pick up every different type of nutrition as well as gear so don't worry if you've forgotten anything back home.

Registration is over by the sports centre and the queues get really large so I would advise going early. We went at midday and there was a ten minute queue inside the hall but by five that day they were queing way out of the door. I was getting some decent nerves at this point and registration did little to quell them. I'm used to fairly relaxed registrations but this was the opposite. Everything was very strict and scrutinised but for good reason as they know full well how dangerous the weather and conditions can be. There was a long list of the race rules and penalties which were comprehensive and severe whilst also being really encouraging:

> 1 hour penalty for not immediately assisting another runner who is in need.

They only checked a certain portion of the kit list (torch, spare batteries, jacket, phone, whistle) though they did so thoroughly. I had forgotten to pack spare batteries and I thought I might have had to come back later but thankfully they let me through after promising to go and get some straight after. The man next to me was refused as his jacket had a tear on the inside. After the kit check you move to another station where they give you your race pack, another station where they take the bag label and bracelet from the pack and put them on you, then a final one where they give you a bag with a few goodies in it. This bag, though it wasn't explained, is the bag you need to use on the race day to leave at the start with any spare clothes that you want transported back to Chamonix. There is a sticker inside that you need to attach with your name on.

The last thing I wanted to double check at registration was how the buses worked on the day. I had a document I'd printed out with my name and bus time on it, just below the bold words *"This is not a ticket"*. As it turns out once I'd queued and asked, this was the ticket. And, as it happens, no one checks at the bus anyway so this part was very stress free. I can't imagine the drivers thought anyone would try to sneak a free bus to Switzerland at 4.30am.

After you're done at registration it really is time to relax and get as much rest as you can before the race. Adorned with your new UTMB bracelet, you suddenly spot everyone else racing and try to figure out which race they're doing. I was proud to be wearing mine even if it was the shortest race, and in awe of those wearing the longer distance ones (even more so after I had completed mine).

There are kids races on the day before the OCC which has a really nice vibe to it and we sat in the sun and watched them run up the learner ski slope next to Brevent. I laid out all my kit and made it as simple as possible to get everything going in the middle of the night. Then it's just a matter of trying to get as much sleep you can, or any. Near impossible with the nerves and excitement for what is to come the following day.
