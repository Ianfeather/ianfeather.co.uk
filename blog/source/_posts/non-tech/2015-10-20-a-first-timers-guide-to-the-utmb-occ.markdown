The Ultra Trail do Mont Blanc offers five different races over a memorable week in August. This year I decided to do the OCC: the shortest of the five (a measly 54k and 10,000ft of ascent) and the only one that you can do without any qualifying points. I can't recommend it enough, it was an incredible experience start to finish.

I had a lot of questions leading up to it which I couldn't find answers for hence this attempt to provide them for future runners, and perhaps remind myself for next time.

<h2 id="btr-admin" class="blog-subtitle">Before the race - Admin</h2>

The registration period for all of the UTMB races is open for [three weeks, December to January](http://www.ultratrailmb.com/en/page/264/Enrolment.html) and this year you will need to have at least one qualifying point to even enter the OCC. These points are calculated from other ultras you have run throughout the past two years.

The registration is a lottery and last year there were 4,000 applicants for the 1200 places in the OCC. This is one of the reasons they now require a qualifying point for this race. If you get in you need to pay the full amount, otherwise your deposit is returned. I'd have to say the UTMB is one of the best value for money races I've ever been a part of. The organisation is second to none.

If you do get a place then it's time to focus on training but there are also a couple of really important admin pieces remaining. Firstly, you need to send off a Medical Certificate by a certain date. You need to get a doctor's signature on the certificate they provide you which proves you are medically capable of entering the race. This can be sourced from your local GP for a small fee or more simply if you happen to know a doctor who can lend you their signature.

The remaining thing you need to do is to book your place on the bus to the start line. The OCC starts from Orsieres in Switzerland and finishes in Chamonix. Buses start from 4am and the more preferable later ones fill up quickly. The later you book your bus: the earlier you will have to leave for the start line. This means, as I experienced, lots of waiting around in the cold before the race which is best avoided.

Running is one of those beautiful, levelling activities which anyone can do: all you need is a pair of shoes, a pair of lungs and you're on your way. This is less the case with Ultra Marathons though, where you start to descend down the rabbit hole of purchasing technical gear. It can go pretty deep.

There is a required kit list for each of the races designed to keep the runner safe though even within this there is a wide gamut of options. For example, in the OCC you are required to carry a torch though the race is primarily run during the day. The only time you might need to use it is if you were running at the extreme of the allotted time. Of course, you should still absolutely carry a working torch for emergencies but it doesn't need to be the best in class. Alternatively, if you're running the full UTMB where you'll be running through two straight nights you'd very much want the best torch you could get!

For other items, spending more often leads to saving weight which is hugely important. I didn't go so far as to weigh items but I certainly kept a focus on how much I would have to be carrying. Keep your pack small and you limit yourself to only what is absolutely required. Here is the list of kit I used during the race:

*[Salamon S-Lab Sense 4 trail shoes](http://www.wiggle.co.uk/salomon-s-lab-sense-4-ultra-shoes-aw15/)*. Incredible grip and comfort, saved me a few times on the sketchy down hill trails. Would absolutely recommend them: a popular choice amongst the runners at the UTMB.

*Shorts, t-shirt*. Nothing special. Nike.

*Socks*. A cheap purchase of Karrimor Marathon Socks from Sports Direct :) Great comfort and padding.

*[Ultimate Direction Vest](http://www.ultimatedirection.com/p-629-sj-ultra-vest-20.aspx)*. The range of running vests is big in both choice and price. This was a great purchase though, I took the 7l one and it was big enough to carry everything I needed with pockets in lots of different spots for snacks, your phone etc. Very comfortable, sits high on your back and I was personally a big fan of having the water bottles on my front.

*Running Poles*. These are optional but almost all of the non-elites use them. I used a pair of lightweight foldable poles that I borrowed from my mum, no idea on the brand, and she only showed me they could extend taller once I'd finished the race! Still they were the perfect height for ascending and I preferred not to use them on the downhills so I could use my arms for balance. They ups and downs are very long in the alps so it wasn't a bad thing to stop at the peak and take a moment to put them away.

*Waterproofs*. I carried a hiking waterproof jacket which, whilst really good and warm, was too bulky for my pack and took up the majority of the space. There are some excellent running waterproofs which fold down really small and were I to do it again I would probably invest more here. The waterproof jacket is a required item on all the races though as it turned out we ran in thirty degree sunshine all day. The waterproof trousers are optional for the OCC but required for all other races. I chose not to carry any but I would have had the forecast been worse.

*Torch*. I carried a head torch that I bought from Poundland. I probably wouldn't recommend doing that. Thankfully I never had to use it though it worked fine. You are required to carry a torch as well as spare batteries.

*Trousers*. A requirement. I took some cheap Karrimor leggings and never used them except for the journey there.

*Cap*. Indispensable. I took a lightweight [Zone 3 Cap](http://www.wiggle.co.uk/zone3-lightweight-cap/).

*Sunglasses*. I rarely ran with these because you're often running trails with a lot of cover. That said, they're a definite requirement. I went cheap again on these, taking this [dhb](http://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-triple-lens-sunglasses/) pair though I wouldn't recommend them unless you're on a budget.

*Mobile Phone, ID, cash* - All a requirement.

*Extra phone battery*. Definitely not a requirement but I took this lightweight [Anker Battery Case](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00PRXHCPQ) as I wanted to ensure I could track my time/distance on Strava as well as stop and take photos when I wanted. Worked perfectly.

*Nutrition*. I took some [Shot Bloks](http://www.clifbar.com/products/clif-shot/shot-bloks), a Chia bar and a [beetroot shot](http://www.hollandandbarrett.com/shop/product/james-white-drinks-beet-it-beetroot-stamina-shot-60091372). There are enough aid stations to get by without needing to carry too much food. At the stations you generally have a choice of Orange slices, bananas, cheese, sausage, water, tea, coke and soup. The soup was a life saver for me at the last aid station as my stomach was really struggling.

*Water*. I didn't take a bladder, instead opting for just the litre of water in two bottles on the front of the vest. There is water at each aid station as well as at the summits and can occasionally also be found en route. In 30 degree heat that was enough as long as you ensured you had finished both bottles by the time you got to the checkpoint. I added [electrolyte tablets](http://www.wiggle.co.uk/high5-zero-electrolyte-drink-20-tabs/) to most of my water.
