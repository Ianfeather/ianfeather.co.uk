Part 1 of this 2 part series on the UTMB OCC can be found [here](/non-tech/preparing-for-the-utmb-occ) and covers my preparation for the race.

I got out of bed at 3.30am, an hour and a half before my bus was set to leave Chamonix for Orsieres. I had laid out all my kit the night before and, whilst my Sister generously prepared me some porridge, I triple-checked I had everything on my list and collected any provisions I wanted to take to the start line.

The bowl of porridge was topped with banana and I prepared a shake made from Kale, Avocado, Kiwi, Banana, Goji Berries, Blueberries, Pumpkin and Chia seeds. I drank that with my porridge and made another shake which I packed to take to the start line, knowing that I would have nearly three hours between leaving the house and starting the race. In retrospect, I would have had a lighter breakfast. I was mildly panicking, not knowing how much the day would take out of me, but my stomach was unprepared to digest that much at such a peculiar time of the night. For the rest of the day my stomach never felt quite right though I have no way of knowing whether my morning nutrition was the reason or if it was just the ten hours of repetitive movement.

In town there were rows of buses waiting to depart and so I said goodbye to my sister (I would see her again after 34km) and jumped on the first one. Everyone shut their eyes and tried to get some sleep during the 45 minute journey. Even though I'd only had a few hours sleep I wasn't able to get any more. I noticed the guy next to me had picked up one of those temporary transfers of the course profile on his forearm and wished I had done the same. I saw a lot of people wearing them throughout the day.

In Orsieres there's a small hall where everyone congregates and kills time until the rest of the runners to arrive and you head down to the start line. You can get some coffee or join the *long* line for the toilets. Toilet management was pretty key at this point as there is only one in the hall and with a couple of thousand runners in the race this wasn't a scalable solution. Thankfully there are a few more, scattered around on the way down to the start. I was at the back of a queue as the start time crept perilously closer and a friendly Swiss local took pity on us and invited us into his house to use his. That set a trend for the demeanour of the locals that we encountered throughout the day: extremely friendly and supportive.

The start line was a sea of nervous and excited faces. The drones buzzed low above our heads, capturing the scene and beaming it back to the ultra trail headquarters and out to the internet where those back home were able to watch. I adjusted my pack for the thousandth time and rearranged my number. I wore it on my front and I would *hugely* recommend the same to all runners. Lots of people wore them on their hip but they bear your name and the flag of your country and having them on your front meant people could see where you were from and localise their support! I really enjoyed shouts of "Go on GB" or "Bonne chance Ian" as I was running, putting an even bigger smile on my face.

The mayor of Orsieres counted us down to the start and we snaked out of the town at a typically over ambitious starting pace. School kids lined the streets for the first few hundred metres, hands outstretched for limitless high fives, revelling in their allowed truancy. People clapped their running mates on the shoulders and wished each other luck, cracked jokes, veered off to find the nearest tree. I was grinning from ear to ear: so excited to finally be doing it! So much training and preparation, mental and physical, had led to this point and here I was, 54 kilometres, ten hours, and three peaks between myself and the finish line. It was stunningly crisp and clear, cool but warming up towards what would become a 30° day without a cloud in the sky! I felt incredibly fortunate, knowing how unpredictable the weather can be.

I’d read that the first few kilometres are really busy and slow so I’d purposefully positioned myself reasonably near the front. Even so, there really were some slow kilometres and maybe for the first couple of hours you couldn’t run at the pace you wanted to. Perhaps it was a blessing in disguise as it saved energy for later but it certainly added a big chunk of time to a reasonably easy section of the race.

The initial part prior to any trails wound up through tiny Swiss villages lined with support. It was like something from the Tour de France. They flew flags of support and whooped with joy when they managed to see their friends, set out deck chairs and set about enjoying life. One of the first surprises came soon afterwards when we reached the first incline, still on a tarmacced road: everyone walked!

I really hadn't expected that. I'd figured that on the steeper parts it would be faster to hike but hadn't really anticipated that people would be so quick to take to hiking on very runnable terrain. I kept running but it was impossible to get round people so I quickly resorted to dropping into line. In retrospect this probably just proved how naive I was to the entire race. Clearly people had their own strategies on how to complete the race as fast as they could and there would be enough time later to get some running in.

I also quickly realised the danger of running poles. I thought perhaps I might get spiked in the foot but it wouldn't be a huge deal, I hadn't thought that it would actually be my eyes that were more at risk. For whatever reason, a large portion of people thought that holding them with the tips backwards and pointing upwards was a good idea. It really isn't. Keep those tips pointing down!

It was a relatively gentle first 7km up to Champex Lac (relative to the rest of the race, steeper than most of London) and I was feeling great. I'd been looking forward to seeing the lake as it looked great on photos and the weather had conspired to beautifully illuminate it. I ran along the banks and enjoyed probably the only truly flat part of the day, stopping to take photos along the way. I wasn't running for a particular time and had no guilt stopping to take photos and enjoy the scenery. Not that you could miss it anyway, three hundred and sixty degrees of nature's finest work.

Champex Lax was the site of the first checkpoint: a tent with a few benches and water and energy drink reservoirs. As we'd only been going just over an hour there was no real need to stop at this stage, save briefly to refill water bottles. The tent was surrounded on both sides by support and a contingent of British supporters gave me a great exit. From there we began our first real ascent as we headed up towards La Giete at just over 2000m.

The going wasn't too bad, initially very steep as we scrambled up a narrow trail for one or two kilometres and then out into a long, meandering path up the side of the mountain. This became the most spectacular part of the run, the views were breathtaking (as if the run wasn't already) and I was still fresh enough to be able to focus on enjoying it, taking some photos and chatting to others along the way.
