A lot of people who want to get in to Triathlons are put off by the swimming stage. Understandably. Certainly in the UK we're not a nation of swimmers and the memory of school swim lessons hardly evoke pangs of nostalgia. I had the exact same trepidation before signing up to my first Tri in 2014. Don't let the fear put you off getting started: it can actually transform from a bore to one of those gratifyingly frustrating quests for honing your technique towards perfection.

I'm not an expert swimmer by any stretch, but I have gone from not being able to do more than a length of frontcrawl to being able to swim 1500m in 30 minutes and emerge feeling fresh. Far from lightning speed but also respectable. Here's the advice I can give you if you have similar goals:


<h2 id="forget-school" class="blog-subtitle">Forget everything (about swimming) they taught you at school.</h2>

Swimming in a triathlon isn't about being the quickest out of the block: it's about conserving your leg muscles for the ensuing bike and run. Even at the top level you're never going to win the race on the swim (though you might lose it). This is generally why you don't see people swimming breakstroke at triathlons as it's much more leg intensive.

Having said that, you absolutely can swim breaststroke! The only stroke you aren't allowed to do is backstroke though I've never seen someone audacious enough to break out the butterfly either. Breaststroke is a simpler stroke and one people often fall back on when they run out of breath on frontcrawl and that's ok!

If you're interested in lerning frontcrawl properly though, my number one tip is to watch this video series. Seriously, it will change the way you swim. By applying science and study to the technique of moving yourself through the dense medium of water: you can move faster and more easily through the dense medium of water. Who would have thought it?

<h2 id="try-it" class="blog-subtitle">Get in the water and try it out!</h2>

My first attempt at swimming long distances was a crossing of a 400m wide lake in Poland. The difference before and after applying the techniques described above were astonishing, it was significantly easier almost immediately. I went from struggling to do more than a few strokes without having to resort back to breastroke, to swimming the entirety in frontcrawl.

You're not going to learn anything out of the water though, head down to your local pool and see for yourself how much easier it can be. That fire in your lungs and thrashing of the water can soon evolve into a gentle meditative glide.


<h2 id="take-it-outdoors" class="blog-subtitle">Take it outdoors.</h2>

If you're doing your Tri in the UK, or anywhere non-tropical, the chances are you're going to be doing your swim in a wetsuit. This comes with one major advantage: wetsuits are more buoyant. You will spend less time worrying about floating and can concentrate more on your stroke. It also means you'll go faster but it does take a little bit of getting used to. If you don't feel like forking out for a wetsuit not knowing if you're going to enjoy it, there are companies who will rent you one for the season and give you the option of returning it or buying it at the end.

Most indoor pools don't allow the use of wetsuits so you'll need to find somewhere outdoors. There are plenty of swimming lakes outside of London and across the UK which provide you with a venue and a visibility level of about 50cm, but we also have a great selection of Lidos.

    <figcaption class="fig-caption">Brockwell Lido</figcaption>
  </div>

Lidos are amazing for a number of reasons:

<ol>
  <li>They're usually old which means they have some interesting architecture or at least a bit more about them.</li>
  <li>They're generally next to a good cafe.</li>
  <li>It's common to see 50m or even longer ones.</li>
  <li>They are full of good swimmers and often Triathlon clubs.</li>
</ol>

The latter is an important one because I found it really useful to study other people's techniques while I was trying to improve mine. Even Alistair and Jonny Brownlee train at Ilkley Lido. Triathlon clubs often do their training at Lidos and this can be a great way of asking advice and meeting people with similar goals.


<h2 id="take-a-lesson" class="blog-subtitle">If you get the bug - take a lesson.</h2>

If you can afford it and are keen on improving your stroke, I found taking a swim lesson a fascinating, and really fun, experience. There are a lot of TI coaches across the world who specialise in training for Triathlon and long distance swimming.

I took a few lessons with Sam Williams at [Swim Studio London](http://www.swimstudiolondon.com/). He has an endless pool (essentially a swim treadmill) which is rigged up with a bunch of different cameras. Lessons are 60 minutes but you swim for only about 20. The rest of the time you are replaying video and working on different parts of the stroke. A really interesting and worthwhile thing to do.


<h2 id="keep-it-interesting" class="blog-subtitle">Keep it interesting.</h2>

Even if you get into the technique part of it all, putting in the distance can still be quite repetitive. Some people like to listen to music underwater with the seemingly new, and still magic to me, underwater headphones. I prefer to keep it interesting by mixing up the location and it's amazing some of the publicly available places there are to swim, you don't have to pay Â£60 a month to join a gym just to use the pool.

That the Olympic Pool is municipal and you can use it for under a Fiver is incredible. Use it while it lasts because it must be costing a fortune to run that place. The pool on Marshall Street, just off Carnaby Street and hidden right in the centre of London, is also a work of art and it's white marble floor is pretty special to swim above.

[Swim Dem Crew](http://www.swimdemcrew.co.uk/) in London meet weekly and mix up the venue around London. They also help teach people to swim and have taken complete newcomers to triathlon level. Other swim clubs are available.


<h2 id="swim-where-you-cant-cheat" class="blog-subtitle">Swim somewhere you can't cheat.</h2>

This could well be terrible advice but it worked for me. I'm lazy, so when doing lengths, no matter how much I try not to, I always end up cheating and taking a little break every now and again. To combat this every time I was on holiday I searched for a lake I could swim across or an island I could swim to and just went for it. Slightly dangerous so ideal if you can do it in a pair or at least have someone on the bank watching you. That feeling when you're halway across and getting tired is something else though...


<h2 id="enter-a-swim-only-race" class="blog-subtitle">Enter a swim only race.</h2>

The [Great Swim Series](http://www.greatrun.org/great-swim/) organise 1 mile races across the UK. These are a good idea to enter just to give yourself an idea of how you will feel after a race and how it is to swim closely alongside others. From my experience they're not particularly competitive so you can go at your own pace and not have to worry about others swimming across your back as might happen in a Tri.

<h2 id="on-race-day" class="blog-subtitle">On race day.</h2>

Don't panic.

Don't pull your goggle so tight, fearing they'll be kicked off, that you end up with a splitting headache all the way around.

Pull your wetsuit up as high as you can around your shoulders. The more room you can make there the less restrictive you will find it.

If you're nervous start towards the back of your wave, you'll have the chance to move past people as there'll be plenty of room and you'll avoid being kicked in the face of having some one swim across you. If you start near the front this will absolutely happen but be forgiving, you'll likely be able to see very little underwater and no one is actively trying to bump into you. If you want some free water just move to the side and you'll be back on your own.

If you get tired, get in someone's swimlane. It's amazing how much easier it is to swim behind someone else, when the water is already moving towards you. If you're starting to fatigue this can be a great way to take a moment to relax your muscles and stretch out in long easy strokes whilst still gliding forward easily. Often it can actually be detrimental to move ahead of someone into clear water so bear this in mind. It's quite a hard balance to find though.

Enjoy it. Take a moment to remember that X months ago you couldn't swim further than 50m without a break and now you're 1km into your first triathlon. That's a big step up and something to be proud of.
