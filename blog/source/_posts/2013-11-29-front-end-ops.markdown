I recently spoke at [@frontendlondon](http://twitter.com/frontendlondon) on this subject. I thought about writing a blog post about it but in the end I published my slides in html and have tried to include as much detail as possible.

Hitting 'i' at any point will reveal some more detail and useful links about each topic. It was a pretty high level talk so nothing goes into too much detail: follow the links and explore the parts you're interested in.


The [presentation](http://www.ianfeather.co.uk/presentations/front-end-ops) was built using [impress.js](bartaz.github.io/impress.js/â€Ž) and I used remote-impress for the presentation. Both tools were fantastic and easy to use.
