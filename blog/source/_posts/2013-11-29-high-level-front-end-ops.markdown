Recently I've had the unenviable task of interviewing a *lot* of Front End Developers and it's become apparant that not many are exposed to the operational side of our jobs. This is far from a necessity to work at Lonely Planet but any experience is a huge bonus. 

I chose to speak [@frontendlondon](http://twitter.com/frontendlondon) on this subject but, given the small audience, I wanted to create a guide that would work online in isolation from the talk. As such I created this interactive overview exposing some of the core concepts of Front End Ops.

This guide will not cover topics such as Grunt, Bower or Yeoman, instead it approaches the subject at a broader level. Hitting 'i' at any point will reveal some more background and some useful links about each topic that was covered, in order to allow the user to learn more about each if interested.

The [presentation](http://www.ianfeather.co.uk/presentations/front-end-ops) was built using [impress.js](bartaz.github.io/impress.js/â€Ž) and I used remote-impress for the presentation. Mobile devices are served a more linear version of the guide so it is reccomended to view it on a desktop if you have access to one.
